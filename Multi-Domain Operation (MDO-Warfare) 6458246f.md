# Capturing Objectives

Each point of interest will have a small group of AI enemy to both sides protection tier area. Players will first ave to neutralize them to start the cap process.  Once the area has been cleared you will need to restore power and communication to the area in order start the collecting resources.&#x20;

<br>

**Power Grid-**

![smart-grid-powergrid.png](files/c891b446-64ba-432f-bda5-82c45377a6b5/smart-grid-powergrid.png)

Power generator will need to be linked to Radio comms and can be destroyed breaking down Radio communication of a team in the area. Power generators will also be used to power other important assets like Re-Spawn system of an area that has been taken or captured. These in-game mechanical components enforce players to work together, communicate and encourages some level of pre-planning.

**Power Generator**: will have Array set to distance to check for equipment that can be linked together, with a check (if) distance is > than x, will run

(If) distance is \< than x, will not run

Distance is Sphere x,y,z this allows for height on mountains or hill to play a factor with range.

<br>

<br>

# Communication&#x20;

**Radios** - Comms to be used with Mesh Mobile Systems.

![fig1JTNC.gif](files/9da97508-4e0c-4372-8ad1-90bcecafade0/fig1JTNC.gif)

Local Comms Radio works with *Short Range Radio*. In order to have long range radio comms on the map a network of mobile radio system, that have a different range value must be set up and linked together for the entire team to communicate with all assets. Links can be broken, and short range can still be used to achieve the mission.

![606.jpg](files/bbbcfe58-16af-426b-b599-2cf7add6c9b3/606.jpg)

# Satellite

**Satellite***:* has the ability to link all communications across the map. This is progress function that will allow you to link everyone together all comms across the map. Time or progress of captured areas will unlock this for the your team. &#x20;

<br>

![raido two.jpg](<files/2d5e42db-8ee0-4cf8-bfd4-702a117c8ac6/raido two.jpg>)

<br>

**Radios**: will have Array set to distance to check for equipment that can be linked together, with a check (if) distance is > than x, signal works

(If) distance is \< than x, signal derogates

Distance is Sphere x,y,z this allows for height on mountains or hill to play a factor with range.

<br>

**Aircraft**- will have their own comms directly to Squad Leaders and Commander. Special Radios will need to be used.

<br>

**Salvage Vehicle** - is used to salvage destroy vehicles. Player will need drive to the destroy vehicle and select the function key to "Salvage Vic". For each vehichle salvaged, resources will be added to the Motor Pool Economy for your team.&#x20;

Two ways to Salvage:

1. &#x20;If the vehicle is scrapped in the field (x) amount will be at the the motor pool.&#x20;
2. If the destroy vehicle towed by a Salvage Vehicle and driven back to the main Motor Pool, (2 x's) the amount of resources will be added to the team or an extra vehicle asset that is equivalent to the salvage will be added the team assets reserve.&#x20;

Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement MTVR (Supplies):  The MTVR can carry a payload of seven tons or up to fifteen tons driving on smoother surfaces, while simultaneously being able to tow an eleven ton load. The MTVR is highly adaptable for any cargo hauling, carrying or winching. It's wide versatility makes the MTVR an integral part of the  logistical backbone. This vehicle is the prime mover for the M777 howitzer, troops, fuel, water and a wide variety of other equipment.
