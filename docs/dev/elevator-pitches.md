Title: "BattleSpace: Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare)"

## Introduction:

&#x20;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Impact Studios, where we are developing a groundbreaking game called "BattleSpace." Today, I am here to present a 30-minute elevator pitch for funding this ambitious project. "BattleSpace" is a large-scale open-world, multiplayer, strategic shooter game that combines land, sea, and air combat. It offers an immersive and action-packed experience, allowing players to engage in simi-tactical military operations across vast terrains. With its economy-based gameplay and emphasis on teamwork and strategy, "BattleSpace" promises to revolutionize the military shooter genre. Let's dive into the details.

## Game Overview:

&#x20;In "BattleSpace," players will assume the roles of BLUFOR or OPFOR members and lead their factions in dominating the enemy across different conflict areas. The game features massive maps ranging from 7.6 kilometers up to 450 square kilometers, replicating current conflict zones. This realism allows players to experience the challenges faced by modern military forces.

**Land Warfare:** The first phase of "BattleSpace" focuses on land warfare, offering PvP and PvE gameplay. Players will control soldiers, vehicles, and logistics systems, progressing individually and as part of a larger unit. This phase teaches combat skills, methods, and weapon systems in diverse terrains and weather conditions.

# Theme and Setting

### Our featured game mode: Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare)

At the start of the game players will be able to set up their own unit squad size team of 13 Max players within one unit. All unit members will be able to respawn after death or remain incapacitated until a team medic has revived the player. Players have to select 1 of the 14 roles from [The Team House ](https://app.nuclino.com/Impact-Studios-LLC/Game-Design-Document/The-Team-House-Characters-9b1d21b2-72f8-4b22-b9e2-1c2b83285eaf "Nuclino")Characters. Each having their own unique loadouts and capabilities of function for the unit needs.

- [Designated Defensive Marksman / Sniper]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/roles/designated-marksman)
- [Combat Engineer]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/roles/combat-engineer)
- [Medic ]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/roles/medic)
- [Pilot]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/roles/pilot)
- [CrewMan ]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/roles/crew-man)

[**Commanders**]() will be able to purchase equipment and vehicles for his teams, build constructable infrastructure that will need to be built and upgraded in order to unlock advance weapons and assets (ie.. armor, vehicles and aircraft) that the team can use to take more territory.

At the outset of a mission, a commander's primary duty is to secure a suitable location for the base. While this may be predetermined, it is often random. A strong location must be defensible and possess a flat terrain that allows for the construction of buildings. It is unwise to build structures on uneven ground, as it can impair the movement of troops and equipment.

- Intelligence
- Movement and Maneuver
- Fire Support
- Protection
- Sustainment
- Command and Control

Players can build defenses in towns, subject to certain conditions. Only one commander per side is allowed, who is selected at the beginning of the game, and can be voted in or out at any point. Communication, planning, and teamwork will be essential for victory. As players take back territories, they will also need to set up basic infrastructure in each area they gain control of.

Although the game's geographic setting remains largely accurate, it incorporates elements of realistic combined arms tactics on expansive battlefields, as well as simulations of smaller Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and asymmetrical warfare scrimmage taking place across the map. These scenarios can be set in various times and weather conditions.

The fortification of towns can be carried out through the application of appropriate procedures and protocols. These measures may involve the erection of barricades, construction of obstacles, and deployment of defensive assets in strategic locations to create a defensible perimeter. It is worth noting that these defenses can be implemented only if the appropriate command and control structures are in place. Therefore, the selection of a Commander, who is tasked with directing and overseeing the activities of the units, is paramount. The Commander is chosen at the start of the game and is subject to a vote from the team. This ensures that the individual leading the team is capable, competent, and capable of executing the strategies that are required to achieve success on the battlefield.

# Maps

### [Land Locations:]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/levels/land-locations)

Ukraine is just one of several other BattleSpace "Land Warfare" we are looking to add to our War Series. We are looking at Ukraine, Alaska, , Taiwan, Poland, Falkland Islands.

### [Maritime Locations:]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/levels/maritime-levels)

From the South China Sea to the Falkland Island are just several other BattleSpace "Maritime Warfare" we are looking to add to our War Series. These locations are selected to highlight the features of our game from island hopping all the way to establishing large beachhead assault to gain a foothold for a wider land conflict.

# Live Stats

Real Time Stats (RTS) - (working name) will gather various data from in-game about what players do in game. This data can offer value to players, tactics planners, map makers, modders, server admins. Heat maps can track and record game for group to see how game flow develop throughout all play time.

# Economy System

Players can gain resources, referred to as supply points, by capturing cities on the map. The acquisition of money is another resource, and can be obtained through killing enemy units, recovery of destroyed assets and capturing cities. Resources will also be gained from Live Stats data.&#x20;

Each player will have their own personal economy system, which they can use to purchase better equipment, weapons, and assets to aid them in the game. This economy is generated by capturing territories, scoring kills, and destroying enemy assets. In addition to this, players can also earn resources by salvaging destroyed vehicles and assets and returning them to their team's motor pool or hangar, or by completing tasks related to capturing towns, cities, or other areas. The size of the captured territory determines the amount of resources the team gains.

# Medical

Players will have to implement basic TCCC better known as â€œTactical Combat Casualty Careâ€ into the game to help educate players on real life evidence-based, life-saving techniques and strategies for providing the best trauma care on the battlefield.

Casualty Assessment and Treatment Cards

- Control Massive External Hemorrhage
- Tourniquet Application
- Hemostatic Dressing Application
- Splinting of an Extremity Fracture
- Treatment of Sucking Chest Wound /Apply Vented Chest Seal
- Needle Thoracostomy (Needle Chest Decompression)

Pain Management

- Administration of Morphine (IV or IO)
- Administration of Epinephrine  (IV or IO)
- Administration of Hypertonic Saline 3 or 5% (IV)

Types of Injury:

- Heavy Bleeding â€“ Gunshot - Explosive Blast
- Light Bleeding â€“ Gunshot
- Chest Wound â€“ Gunshot - Explosive Blast
- Broken or Amputation Extremity â€“ Gunshot - Explosive Blast - Falling - Vehicle    Impact

Types of Deaths:

- Head Shot
- Pink Mist
- Massive Hemorrhage
- Traumatic Amputation Limbs

# Game Progression

The intense action of "Battlespace" is divided into three distinct operational progression trees for land, sea, and air. Each tree presents unique vehicles, aircrafts, weaponry, and gear, as well as its own set of challenges to overcome. As you and your team conquer more territory, your company size unit will receive special assets to unlock and utilize within the battlespace. Additionally, engage in PvP and command & control gameplay, building and defending key locations within the game level. The longer you hold areas and build infrastructure, the more resources you gain to fund the war effort.

# Factors of Winning

One side must destroy the other side the capability of being combat effective. This is done by disrupting and destroying the other teams power grid, equipment and their military asset, including all construction facilities built by the other teams Commander. The end game is to push back the other team off the entire map and control all or the majority objectives areas on the map before the time and resources run out. Players will also have additional task to do that link each captured area to power and communication grid before moving to the next objectives and maintain control of these infrastructure. Captured links that are broken will block resources gained from that area. Capture areas that are linked to those points will also prevent the team from collecting resources.

Forward Operating Base (FOB) spawn points will not work for the occupating team until grids links are re-established. Towns captured, each killed soldier or destroyed vehicles, aircraft, FOB, and other assets will have a resources value that will apply to the teams OP-Fund.

# Game Modes:

1. Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare) - Large-scale full-size maps with combined arms with an economy system.
2. Fortification (FO) - Large-scale, full-size maps with combined arms tactics.
3. Capture & Hold (CH) - Medium size maps, random selected capture points with combined arms tactics.
4. Extraction (EX) - Smaller maps, infantry and mechanized base tactics for E\&E.

# Multiplayer:

"Battlespace" features a robust multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against each other in a variety of game modes. The multiplayer mode features a variety of maps and allows players to customize their loadouts and abilities to suit their playstyle.

"Battlespace" is an epic military game that combines land, sea, and air combat. With a range of vehicles, weapons, and equipment, as well as a deep strategic component, the game offers endless hours of exciting gameplay for fans of the genre. With a gripping action and stunning visuals, "BattleSpace" is a must-play for any military game enthusiast.

***Phase #1**:* Land Warfare modular system, will be the PvP and or PvE, ground base systems for soldiers, vehicles, logistical and individual progression systems.

***Land warfare:*** or ground warfare is the process of military operations eventuating in combat that takes place predominantly on the battlespace land surface of the planet by the use of large numbers of combat personnel employing a diverse set of combat skills, methods and a wide variety of weapon systems and equipment, conducted in diverse terrains and weather environments. The game is set in a current and pass conflicts between OPFOR and BLUFOR, with players taking on the role of different military team members who are tasked with leading their forces to victory.

***Phase #2**:* Aerial Warfare modularly system, will be PvP air to air and air to ground combat systems with some of the Maritime Warfare with Aircraft Carriers' as takeoff and economy system.

***Aerial Warfare***: is a variety complex system that encompasses aircraft, helicopters, air refueling tankers and drones in air combat. Air Combat Maneuvering (also known as ACM or dogfighting) is the tactical art of moving, turning and situating a fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft. It relies on offensive and defensive Basic Fighter Maneuvering (BFM) to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent. Aerial warfare series starts out conducting air to air combat missions to softening up opponentâ€™s air assets prior to any landing force conduct land warfare. Before your Army and Navy can move in closer to the coastlines, enemy aircraft and air defense systems must be knocked out in order to provide a proper beachhead assault.

***Phase #3:*** Will be combining all three systems Aerial, Land and Maritime systems working together into Multi-Domain Operation (MOD- Warfare) platform game.

***Maritime Warfare*****:** is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other battlespace involving a major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. Battles have been fought on water for more than 3,000 years. The armed forces branch designated for naval warfare is a navy. Naval tactics and doctrine is the collective name for methods of engaging and defeating an enemy ship or fleet in battle at sea during naval warfare, the naval equivalent of military tactics on land. Naval tactics are distinct from naval strategy.

When considering maritime warfare, there are two points to bear in mind from the outset. The first is that the object of maritime warfare is ultimately to affect outcomes on the land. The second point is that success in maritime warfare requires the ability to operate at sea, in the air, and on the land. Maritime warfare can best be understood through an appreciation of the strategy it is intended to serve. The benefits of a maritime strategy are not confined to island nations. The ability to use the sea for its own purposes is vital to any nation that relies on maritime trade for its existence and similarly, for those with exposed seaboards, to ensure they cannot be invaded. In fact, any nation that has a desire for security, wealth, and power needs to be able to use the seas freely and assert their right to do so when necessary.

Maritime warfare in relations to "Battlespace" will be limited in the beginning as solely as platforms to stage beachheads, island hopping and also the ability to move mass numbers of forces from one area of the map to another. For overall big picture, Battlespace is definite working on allowing the Navy platform to conduct some kinetic operations that are coupled and coordinated with land forces ie. like sending limited Tomahawk missiles strikes and other capabilities to destroy targets that have been selected by commander.

As a member of a company-sized unit, players will be comprised coalition foreign fighters, success will depend on the players ability to collaborate effectively with foreign players from different countries from around the globe on the internet.

In "Battlespace," victory on the battlefield requires careful pre-planning of tactics and logistics during the staging phase. It's essential to strategize and coordinate with your team to ensure success in the mission.

Effective communication and cohesive teamwork are crucial elements in achieving success. You must work together to overcome challenges and complete objectives. The key to success is to communicate clearly, coordinate your actions, and support each other when needed.

As you reclaim territory, it's essential to establish rudimentary infrastructure in each area under your control. This will allow you to build up your resources and provide support for your troops. From building bases to repairing vehicles, your infrastructure will be essential in maintaining control over the battlefield.

Remember, success in "Battlespace" depends on your ability to plan, coordinate, and communicate effectively with your team. Players will have to work together, establish an infrastructure, and take control of the battlefield!

At the outset of a mission, a commander's primary duty is to secure a suitable location for the base. While this may be predetermined, it is often random. A strong location must be defensible and possess a flat terrain that allows for the construction of buildings. It is unwise to build structures on uneven ground, as it can impair the movement of troops and equipment.

- Intelligence
- Movement and Maneuver
- Fire Support
- Protection
- Sustainment
- Command and Control

Players can build defenses in towns, subject to certain conditions. Only one commander per side is allowed, who is selected at the beginning of the game, and can be voted in or out at any point. Communication, planning, and teamwork will be essential for victory. As players take back territories, they will also need to set up basic infrastructure in each area they gain control of.

Although the game's geographic setting remains largely accurate, it incorporates elements of realistic combined arms tactics on expansive battlefields, as well as simulations of smaller Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and asymmetrical warfare scrimmage taking place across the map. These scenarios can be set in various times and weather conditions. Players will be able to pick up weapons from fallen soilders from both side but can only rearm them from scavenging other dead bodies or if they returned back to the armory at headquarters and if the research facilities have been upgraded. &#x20;

The fortification of towns can be carried out through the application of appropriate procedures and protocols. These measures may involve the erection of barricades, construction of obstacles, and deployment of defensive assets in strategic locations to create a defensible perimeter. It is worth noting that these defenses can be implemented only if the appropriate command and control structures are in place.

Therefore, the selection of a Commander, who is tasked with directing and overseeing the activities of the units, is paramount. The Commander is chosen at the start of the game and is subject to a vote from the team. This ensures that the individual leading the team is capable, competent, and capable of executing the strategies that are required to achieve success on the battlefield.

# Live Stats

Real Time Stats (RTS) - (working name) will gather various data from in-game about what players do in game. This data can offer value to players, tactics planners, map makers, modders, server admins. Heat maps can track and record games for group to see how the game flow develop throughout the play time.

# Economy System

Players can gain resources, referred to as supply points, by capturing cities on the map. The acquisition of money is another resource, and can be obtained through killing enemy units, recovery of destroyed assets and capturing cities. Resources will also be gained from Live Stats data.

Each player will have their own personal economy system, which they can use to purchase better equipment, weapons, and assets to aid them in the game. This economy is generated by capturing territories, scoring kills, and destroying enemy assets. In addition to this, players can also earn resources by salvaging destroyed vehicles and assets and returning them to their team's motor pool or hangar, or by completing tasks related to capturing towns, cities, or other areas. The size of the captured territory determines the amount of resources the team gains.

<br>

**Power Station -** A power station, also referred to as a power plant and sometimes generating station or generating plant, is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid.


<br>

**Modbile Power Station** - The most robust and reliable power solutions for defense or offensive needs. It allow the start of the network for the power to be set up to each area captured.  This powers your FOB Spawn point and other equipment that requires power grid.


<br>

Comms Tower - Comms towers will need to be built for each town in order to complete the capture of the town. Comms towers must have power to complete this task.


<br>

**Forward Operating Base (FOB) -** Static harden spawns point.


<br>

### Boat Marina : the building that allows players to purchase and utilize small vessels. Commander must place these near a body of water in order for them to function properly.


<br>

**Armory** - a military storage compound where machine guns, rifles, pistols, ammunition, parts, explosives and accessories are kept. **Armory** - loadout menu will be accessed from here for players to buys and build thier kits. Kits can only be changed in at this location.&#x20;


<br>

**Research Facilities** -research laboratory focused on cutting-edge scientific discovery, technological innovation, and transition of knowledge products that offer incredible potential to improve the militaryâ€™s chances of surviving and winning any future conflicts. This will be where upgrades for equpment, vehicles and aircraft is done. This controls the advancement of technology on the battlefield. Once goal and resources have been achieved it will unlock the new tech allowing the players to build better vehicles or aircraft and use better equipment.


<br>

**Communications Center** -The nerve center or war room is primarily a communications facility where audio, video and digital communication is relayed and analyzed by military staffers who evaluate and correlate various pieces of information to discern the level at which a concern should be elevated. If the communication center is destoryed the VOIP will go down for the team and only Local VOIP will work.


<br>

**HQ -** The military installation from which a commander performs the functions of command. This must be the first build before the commander can build any other buidings.&#x20;


<br>

**Hanger** - Storage for air asset assigned to each squad.  Captured vehicles can be salvage or recovered back to the main base to be repaired and reused or cashed out as resources for building different vehicles.  Aircratf can be built there for usage.



<br>

**Portable Helipad -** Within a minute you can create a stable, permanent or temporary landing zone. It takes one Engineer and commander to install a pad. Here, helicopters operations can be conducted. The pad will be the spawn points for any Rotary Aircraft, rearm, repair and refueling. Please note if the pad is damage in any way the pad will not be able to conduct these fuctions until they have been reapired by an engineer class.&#x20;



<br>

<br>

**Motor Pool** - Function that is storage for vehicles asset assigned to each squad.  Captured vehicles can be salvage or recovered back to the main base to be repaired and reused or cashed out as resources for building different vehicles.  Vehicles can be built there for usage.


<br>

**Salvage Vehicle** - is used to salvage destroy vehicles. Player will need drive to the destroy vehicle and select the function key to "Salvage Vic". For each vehichle salvaged, resources will be added to the Motor Pool Economy for your team.

Two ways to Salvage:

1. &#x20;If the vehicle is scrapped in the field (x) amount will be at the the motor pool.
2. If the destroy vehicle towed by a Salvage Vehicle and driven back to the main Motor Pool, (2 x's) the amount of resources will be added to the team or an extra vehicle asset that is equivalent to the salvage will be added the team assets reserve.
   <br>


<br>

<br>

**Repair Vehicle -** is mobile repair vehicle that can speed up the repair time. The Vehicle that is being repaied must not be totally destroyed in order to be repaired. If the vehicle is totally destroyed that vehcile Mesh will be deleted after X amount of time .


<br>

**Fuel Truck** - Mobile refuel truck for all types of vehicles and aircratf.


<br>

<br>

**Medical Evacuation Vehicle -** is a mobile medical vehicle that is used to heal players that are forward on the battlefield and is also used to for the medic player to build one stats MASH. Each vehicle can build one and can be broken back down and moved forward to another location. If the MASH is destroyed the vehicle will have to return to a rearm and resupply location to replenish the MASH.


<br>

UAV Container - the UAV container is where the commander will have to utilize any drone function within the game container must be within range of the headquarter building or the mobile HQ vehicle.


<br>

**Drones** : IRS in the sky. An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), also known as a combat drone, colloquially shortened as drone or battlefield UAV, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is used for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance and carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles, ATGMs, and/or bombs in hardpoints for drone strikes.

<br>

**Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement MTVR**:  The MTVR can carry a payload of seven tons or up to fifteen tons driving on smoother surfaces, while simultaneously being able to tow an eleven ton load. The MTVR is highly adaptable for any cargo hauling, carrying or winching. It's wide versatility makes the MTVR an integral part of the  logistical backbone. This vehicle is the prime mover for the M777 howitzer, troops, IRB, fuel, water and a wide variety of other equipment.


<br>

**Improved Ribbon Bridge (IRB)** : is a modern floating bridge system. It is designed to provide ground forces with the capability to transport heavy military equipment such as loaded heavy equipment transporter (HET), weapons systems, wheeled / tracked combat vehicles, trucks, suppliers and troops over rivers, and wet gap obstacles. Requires an engineer and full supply truck or **MTVR** to build each section.


<br>

### Electronic Warfare (EW) Jamming - Function it can be used to deny adversaries the ability to either disrupt or use these signals.  Radios will be blocked 120 seconds over a selected area and 10 min cool down time.


<br>

**Rally Spawn Point (RSP)** - Mobile spawn point that can be trip if enemy is near.


<br>

### Boat Marina : the building that allows players to purchase and utilize small vessels. Commander must place these near a body of water in order for them to function properly.

# Game Progression

The intense action of "Battlespace" is divided into three distinct operational progression trees for land, sea, and air. Each tree presents unique vehicles, aircrafts, weaponry, and gear, as well as its own set of challenges to overcome. As you and your team conquer more territory, your company size unit will receive special assets to unlock and utilize within the battlespace. Additionally, engage in PvP and command & control gameplay, building and defending key locations within the game level. The longer you hold areas and build infrastructure, the more resources you gain to fund the war effort.

# Capturing Objectives

Each point of interest will have a small group of AI enemy to both sides protection tier area. Players will first ave to neutralize them to start the cap process.  Once the area has been cleared you will need to restore power and communication to the area in order start the collecting resources.

# Factors of Winning

One side must destroy the other side the capability of being combat effective. This is done by disrupting and destroying the other teams power grid, equipment and their military asset, including all construction facilities built by the other teams Commander. The end game is to push back the other team off the entire map and control all or the majority objectives areas on the map before the time and resources run out. Players will also have additional task to do that link each captured area to power and communication grid before moving to the next objectives and maintain control of these infrastructure. Captured links that are broken will block resources gained from that area. Capture areas that are linked to those points will also prevent the team from collecting resources.

Forward Operating Base (FOB) spawn points will not work for the occupating team until grids links are re-established. Towns captured, each killed soldier or destroyed vehicles, aircraft, FOB, and other assets will have a resources value that will apply to the teams OP-Fund.

# Game Modes:

1. Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare) - Large-scale full-size maps with combined arms with an economy system.
2. Fortification (FO) - Large-scale, full-size maps with combined arms tactics.
3. Capture & Hold (CH) - Medium size maps, random selected capture points with combined arms tactics.
4. Extraction (EX) - Smaller maps, infantry and mechanized base tactics for E\&E.
