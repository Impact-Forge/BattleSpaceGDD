# Game progression

Welcome soldier! The intense action of "Battlespace" is divided into three distinct operational modes: land, sea, and air. Each mode presents unique vehicles, aircrafts, weaponry, and gear, as well as its own set of challenges to overcome.

In Land Warfare mode, engage in ground combat, and take control of tanks, APCs, and other armored vehicles. The Maritime mode allows you to commandeer naval vessels such as aircraft carriers and destroyers. The Air Combat mode features various aircraft, including fighter jets, attack helicopters, and transport helicopters.

To succeed, you must complete a series of objectives that require close teamwork with your fellow soldiers. As you progress, strategic planning and coordination with other units on the battlefield become increasingly vital.

Choose from a range of weapons and equipment, such as firearms, explosives, and special gadgets to gain an edge in combat. Personalize your loadout before each mission, selecting the tools that best suit your individual style of play.

As you and your team conquer more territory, your company size unit will receive special assets to unlock and utilize within the battlespace. Additionally, engage in PvP and command & control gameplay, building and defending key locations within the game level. The longer you hold areas and build infrastructure, the more resources you gain to fund the war effort. Keep fighting, soldier!

The end game is to push back the other team off the entire map and control all or the majority objectives areas on the map before the time and resources run out. Players will also have additional task to do that link each captured area to power and communication grid before moving to the next objectives and maintain control of these infrastructure. Captured links that are broken will block resources gained from that area. Capture areas that are linked to those points will also prevent the  team from collecting resources .&#x20;

Forward Operating Base (FOB) spawn points will not work for the occupating team until grids links are  re-established. Towns captured, each killed soldier or destroyed vehicles, aircraft, FOB, and other assets will have a resources value that will apply to the teams OP-Fund. &#x20;
