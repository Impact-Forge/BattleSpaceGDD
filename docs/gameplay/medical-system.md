These are areas where bleeding from the wound cannot be controlled by direct pressure. A tourniquet does not work on the wounds on the head, neck, chest or abdomen; never apply a tourniquet on these areas as it can lead to further injury such as nerve damage.![188167574\_max.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/188167574_max.jpg)![download.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/download.png)2) &#x20;Combat Gauze - It stops blood flow. It's inert. It's non-allergenic. The material, pliable and familiar to medical personnel, can be fitted to any size or shape wound (including penetrating wounds).![bd5a68e65484521714ef37dcb8cc4988.webp]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/bd5a68e65484521714ef37dcb8cc4988.webp)3) &#x20;Combat Splint - Splint is designed for emergency management of bone fractures. Proven for treating long bone fractures, it can be used for the humerus, lower arm, wrist, foot and lower leg.![splint.jfif]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/splint.jfif)4) Vented Chest Seal -The vent chest seal design provides 3-vented channels that prevent airflow into the chest cavity during inspiration while allowing air to escape through the vent channels during exhalation.![71aQEN5RJaL.\_AC\_SR263,263\_QL70\_.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/71aQEN5RJaL._AC_SR263,263_QL70_.jpg)[](https://youtu.be/lhSsztkQnAA)<br>5) Needle Chest Decompression -Needle thoracostomy, also called needle decompression, is insertion of a needle into the pleural space to decompress a tension pneumothorax. Needle thoracostomy is an emergency, potentially life-saving, procedure that can be done if tube thoracostomy. A needle decompression involves inserting a large bore needle in the second intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. Once this is done, there should be an audible release as the trapped air, and as the tension is released the patient should begin to improve![Needle Thoracostomy.jfif](<{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Needle Thoracostomy.jfif>)![323414\_1\_En\_19\_Fig1\_HTML.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/323414_1_En_19_Fig1_HTML.png)6) Intramuscular (IM) morphine auto-injectors -During military operations, not only front-line providers, including physicians, paramedics, and medics, can provide an adequate battlefield pain management. Actually, all soldiers carry a combat first aid kit including a Syrette of morphine.![images.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/images.png)7) Epinephrine  auto-injectors - It increases blood flow to the muscles during "fight or flight responses." Epinephrine, another name for the hormone adrenaline, is something our bodies produce naturally. It increases blood flow to the muscles during "fight or flight responses."![generic-epi\_4a168b40-db50-4392-aa3a-d091df8aafe7\_530x@2x.webp]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/generic-epi_4a168b40-db50-4392-aa3a-d091df8aafe7_530x@2x.webp)<br>8) IV Saline -  Fluid resuscitation of the right type and in the right dose reduces mortality and morbidity.![55180dba5afbd39b438b456b.webp]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/55180dba5afbd39b438b456b.webp)
