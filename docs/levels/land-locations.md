# Land Locations

## Overview

Land Warfare in Battlespace focuses on large-scale combined arms operations across realistic geographic theaters. Players engage in territory capture, infrastructure development, and coordinated military operations featuring:

- **Combined Arms Tactics**: Infantry, armor, artillery, and air support coordination
- **Territory Control**: Capturing and securing strategic locations for resource generation
- **Infrastructure Development**: Building defenses, supply lines, and command structures
- **Commander System**: Vote-based leadership with strategic oversight
- **Economy System**: Resource generation through territory capture, kills, and asset salvage

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Six Warfighting Functions
1. **Intelligence**: Reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition
2. **Movement and Maneuver**: Force positioning and tactical mobility
3. **Fire Support**: Artillery, air strikes, indirect fire
4. **Protection**: Defensive structures, force security
5. **Sustainment**: Logistics, supply chains, medical support
6. **Command and Control**: Leadership, coordination, communications

### Territory Mechanics
- **Sector-based progression** through regions
- **Infrastructure requirements** for maintaining control
- **Defensive fortifications** (barricades, obstacles, defensive positions)
- **Resource generation** scales with territory size
- **Supply lines** must be maintained between captured areas

### Coalition Forces
- Multi-national player teams
- Coordinated foreign fighter units
- NATO support and staging areas
- Company-sized unit operations
