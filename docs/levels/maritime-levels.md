# Maritime Levels

## Overview

Maritime Warfare encompasses combat operations in and on major bodies of water including seas, oceans, and strategic waterways. These battlespaces focus on:

- **Beachhead Assaults**: Large-scale amphibious operations to establish footholds for land campaigns
- **Island Hopping**: Strategic capture of key island territories
- **Naval Staging**: Aircraft carriers and naval vessels as mobile operation platforms
- **Force Projection**: Mass troop movements across water-based theaters

Maritime operations serve as critical preludes to land warfare, requiring air superiority and suppression of coastal defense systems before ground forces can advance.

## Maritime Warfare Systems

### Naval Combat Elements
- **Surface Vessels**: Destroyers, frigates, amphibious assault ships
- **Carrier Operations**: F/A-18, F-35C launch and recovery
- **Shore Bombardment**: Naval artillery support for ground forces
- **Anti-Access/Area Denial**: Coastal defense systems

### Amphibious Operations
- **Landing Craft**: Troop and vehicle transport
- **Beach Obstacles**: Mines, wire, defensive positions
- **Fire Support**: Naval gunfire, close air support
- **Logistics**: Supply chains from ship to shore

### Economy & Resources
- **Territory Control**: Capturing port cities and islands
- **Naval Assets**: Carrier groups as resource generators
- **Salvage Operations**: Recovering destroyed vessels and equipment
- **Supply Lines**: Maintaining logistics across water

## Multi-Domain Integration

Maritime warfare integrates with:

1. **Aerial Warfare**: Carrier-based aircraft, air superiority missions
2. **Land Warfare**: Beachhead establishment, coastal invasion
3. **Combined Arms**: Coordinated naval gunfire, air strikes, and ground assault

---

## Development Phases

**Phase 1**: Maritime Warfare core systems (Current)
- Amphibious assault mechanics
- Naval vessel platforms
- Island hopping gameplay

**Phase 2**: Aerial-Maritime Integration
- Carrier operations with PvP air combat
- Air-to-sea and sea-to-air systems
- Naval aviation economy

**Phase 3**: Multi-Domain Operations (MDO)
- Full integration of Land, Air, and Maritime systems
- Theater-level strategic gameplay
- Unified command and control

---

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Large-scale water rendering and physics
- Multiple active naval vessels with complex systems
- Long draw distances for naval engagement ranges
- Dynamic weather and sea states

### Gameplay Systems
- Naval navigation and maneuvering
- Damage models for ships and submarines
- Amphibious vehicle transitions (water-to-land)
- Carrier deck operations (launch, recovery, refueling)
