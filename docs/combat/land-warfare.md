The fortification of towns can be carried out through the application of appropriate procedures and protocols. These measures may involve the erection of barricades, construction of obstacles, and deployment of defensive assets in strategic locations to create a defensible perimeter. It is worth noting that these defenses can be implemented only if the appropriate command and control structures are in place. Therefore, the selection of a Commander, who is tasked with directing and overseeing the activities of the unit, is paramount. The Commander is chosen at the start of the game and is subject to a vote from the team. This ensures that the individual leading the team is capable, competent, and capable of executing the strategies that are required to achieve success on the battlefield.
