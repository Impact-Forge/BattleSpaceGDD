Fortification is a team-based game mode where both sides have a short period at the beginning of the game to build up their fortifications before the game starts. Each team will have an attacking and defending squad, and the goal is to destroy the opposing teamâ€™s fortified base while defending your own base. The catch is that both teams will have to find each other on a larger map, adding another layer of challenge to the gameplay.

Gameplay Mechanics:

At the start of the game, both teams are given a limited amount of resources and time to build their fortifications. Players can use these resources to build walls, bunkers, watchtowers, and other defensive structures to protect their base. Once the fortification period ends, both teams will have to search for each other on a larger map before they can begin their attacks.

The attacking squadâ€™s goal is to infiltrate the enemy base and destroy their fortifications, while the defending squadâ€™s goal is to protect their own base and prevent the enemy from destroying their fortifications. The attacking squad can use vehicles, explosives, and other weapons to breach the enemyâ€™s defenses, while the defending squad can use turrets, mines, and other defensive structures to repel the attackers.

Players must use strategy and work together to search for the enemy team, as the larger map adds an element of uncertainty to the gameplay. Once the teams have located each other, the game can begin in earnest.

The game ends when one team successfully destroys the other teamâ€™s fortified base, or when the time limit expires. The winning team is the one that successfully destroys the enemy base or has the most intact fortifications at the end of the game.

Game Mode Features:

Resource Management: Players must carefully manage their resources to build effective fortifications and weapons.

Tactical Gameplay: Players must work together and use strategy to attack and defend the fortified bases.

Dynamic Environment: Players can destroy and rebuild fortifications, making the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable.

Time Pressure: The limited time at the beginning of the game creates a sense of urgency and encourages players to quickly build their defenses.

Exploration: The larger map adds an element of exploration as players search for the enemy team.

Uncertainty: Players must use strategy and work together to locate the enemy team, adding an element of uncertainty to the gameplay.

Overall, Fortification is a challenging and tactical game mode that requires players to work together and use strategy to destroy the enemyâ€™s fortified base while protecting their own, all while exploring a larger map and searching for the enemy teams. is a team-based game mode where both sides have a short period at the beginning of the game to build up their fortifications before the game starts.
