# Special Abilities

You will be able to provide close air support (CAS) defined as air action such as air strikes by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets near friendly forces and require detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces and attacks with aerial bombs, glide bombs, missiles, rockets, autocannons, machine guns, and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers.&#x20;

Furthermore, pilots will provide Air Assault, which is the movement of ground-based military forces by vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraftâ€”such as the helicopterâ€”to seize and hold key terrain which has not been fully secured, and to directly engage enemy forces behind enemy lines.&#x20;

Finally, will be a key component of logistics behind enemy lines, enable assaulting forces to combine air mobility with a certain degree of ground mechanization and maintaining transportation of reinforcements to the front lines.

# Disadvantages:

Easy targets for surface to air missiles and sitting ducks when sitting on the deck.&#x20;
