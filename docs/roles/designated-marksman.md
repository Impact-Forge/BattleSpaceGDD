# Character Description

Is a soldier trained in precision shooting over a long distance, has the skills of observing and masking. A Sharpshooterâ€™s armament consists mainly of a sniper rifle, a specially selected weapon equipped with an optical sight, night vision device or other sight allowing accurate shooting over long distances. The task of a marksman on the battlefield is to eliminate important targets that appear in a short space of time. Those can be enemy snipers, advisors, heavy weapons support (machine guns, cannons, mortars), crews of armored vehicles damaged on the battlefield, commanders. Designated Defense Marksman must lead the way in preparing a mission plan, ensuring observation, tracking and precise risk reduction in the near, medium and long-range. Sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance, target acquisition and impact feedback for air strikes and artillery, assisting employed combat force with accurate fire support and counter-sniper tactics, killing enemy commanders, selecting targets of opportunity, and even destruction of military equipment, which tend to require use of anti-materiel rifles in the larger calibers such as the .50 BMG, like the Barrett M82, McMillan Tac-50, and Denel NTW-20.
