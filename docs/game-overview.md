# BattleSpace Series

Evolution of an Idea !&#x20;

## Definition:&#x20;

The term "battlespace" generally refers to the physical, digital, and cognitive environments in which military operations take place. It encompasses the entire area in which a military force operates, including land, sea, air, and cyberspace.

Understanding the battlespace is essential for military commanders to effectively plan and execute operations, as well as to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. This requires a thorough understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both friendly and enemy forces, as well as the terrain, weather, and other environmental factors that may impact the operation.

Players will have to dominate the enemy on different terrain from 7.6 kilometers up to 450 square kilometer maps of current conflict areas.

"Battlespace" is a multi-faceted military game that combines land, sea, and air combat. In order to emerge victorious in the game, a faction must incapacitate the adversary's capacity to generate military personnel and carry out combat operations. This objective is accomplished through the complete annihilation of all facilities responsible for production.

Players will have to take on a player role of a BLUFOR or OPFOR member who is tasked with leading a variety of missions across different theatres of operation. The game features a range of vehicles, aircrafts, weapons, and equipment. Players will have focus on fast-paced, tactical combat in a variety of environments. Additionally, players will take on a range of military operations, each with different objectives that require different strategies to complete successfully.

# Theme and Setting

### The Basic Fundamentals "MDO\_Warfare":

At the start of the game players will be able to set up their own unit squad size team of 13 Max players within one unit.  All unit members will be able to respawn after death or remain incapacitated until a team medic has revived the player. Players have to select 1 of the 14  roles from [The Team House ](https://app.nuclino.com/Impact-Studios-LLC/Game-Design-Document/The-Team-House-Characters-9b1d21b2-72f8-4b22-b9e2-1c2b83285eaf "Nuclino")Characters . [Commanders](https://app.nuclino.com/Impact-Studios-LLC/Game-Design-Document/Zulu-Commander-7c5715a7-6819-4634-abf2-3e305730302f "Nuclino") will be able to purchase equipment and vehicles for his teams, build constructable infrastructure that will need to be built and upgraded in order to unlock advance weapons and assets (ie.. armor, vehicles and aircraft) that the team can use to take more territory. &#x20;

At the outset of a mission, a commander's primary duty is to secure a suitable location for the base. While this may be predetermined, it is often random. A strong location must be defensible and possess a flat terrain that allows for the construction of buildings. It is unwise to build structures on uneven ground, as it can impair the movement of troops and equipment.&#x20;

1. Main Power Station
2. Motor Pool
3. Hanger
4. HQ
5. Communications Center
6. Research Facilities
7. Armory
8. Forward Operating Base (FOB)
9. Boat **Marina **

<br>

Each player will have their own personal economy system, which they can use to purchase better equipment, weapons, and assets to aid them in the game. This economy is generated by capturing territories, scoring kills, and destroying enemy assets. In addition to this, players can also earn resources by salvaging destroyed vehicles and assets and returning them to their team's motor pool or hangar, or by completing tasks related to capturing towns, cities, or other areas. The size of the captured territory determines the amount of resources the team gains.

Players can build defenses in towns, subject to certain conditions. Only one commander per side is allowed, who is selected at the beginning of the game, and can be voted in or out at any point. Communication, planning, and teamwork will be essential for victory. As players take back territories, they will also need to set up basic infrastructure in each area they gain control of.

## Aerial Warfare

***Aerial Warfare***:  is a variety complex system that encompasses aircraft, helicopters and drones in air combat. Air Combat Maneuvering (also known as ACM or dogfighting) is the tactical art of moving, turning and situating a fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft. It relies on offensive and defensive Basic Fighter Maneuvering (BFM) to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent.

<br>

Although the game's geographic setting remains largely accurate, it incorporates elements of realistic combined arms tactics on expansive battlefields, as well as simulations of smaller Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and asymmetrical warfare scrimmage taking place across the globe. These scenarios can be set in various times and weather conditions.

## Factors of Winning

One side must destroy the other side the capability of being combat effective. This is done by disrupting and destroying the other teams power grid, equipment and their military asset, including all construction facilities build by the other teams Commander.

# Live Stats

1. Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare) - Large-scale full-size maps with combined arms with an economy system.&#x20;
2. Fortification (FO) - Large-scale, full-size maps with combined arms tactics.&#x20;
3. &#x20;Capture & Hold (CH) - Medium size maps, random selected capture points with combined arms tactics.&#x20;
