# Capital Warfare

**Game Mode Type:** Economy-Driven Territory Control  
**Player Count:** 32v32 (64 players)  
**Match Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced - Requires team coordination and economic awareness

---

## Overview

Capital Warfare represents BattleSpace's core competitive mode where monetary management is as critical as combat effectiveness. Teams compete for economic dominance through strategic territory control, disciplined combat operations, and resource management. Victory is achieved by either bankrupting the enemy team or reaching the capital goal threshold.

Unlike traditional elimination-focused gameplay, every tactical decision carries financial consequences. Player deaths, equipment usage, and territorial control directly impact team resources, creating a dynamic where individual accountability and strategic planning determine success.

## Core Economic System

### War Chest

Each team begins with a **$250,000 War Chest** - the finite pool of capital funding all military operations. This shared resource determines the team's operational capacity throughout the match.

**War Chest Features:**
- Displayed prominently in team HUD
- Real-time income/expense tracking
- Critical threshold warnings at $50,000 remaining
- Visual/audio alerts when approaching bankruptcy

### Operational Costs

All military actions consume War Chest capital:

**Initial Deployment:**
- First spawn of the round: **$100 per player**
- Establishes baseline operational cost

**Respawn Escalation:**
Each subsequent death increases respawn cost for that player:
- 1st death: **$500**
- 2nd death: **$750**
- 3rd death: **$1,000**
- 4th death: **$1,250**
- Continues scaling +$250 per death
- Resets each round (round-based mode) or remains cumulative (continuous mode)

**Equipment Expenditure:**
- Frag Grenade: **$100**
- Smoke Grenade: **$75**
- Flashbang: **$50**
- UAV Strike: **$500**
- Supply Drop: **$300**
- Combat deployables (varies by type)

**Vehicle Operations (Optional/Future Phase):**
- Light Vehicle spawn: **$2,000**
- Heavy Vehicle spawn: **$5,000**
- Vehicle destruction penalty: **$1,500** (light) / **$3,000** (heavy)

### Mercy System

When a team's War Chest falls below **$25,000** (10% of starting capital):
- Respawn costs reduced by 50% for 3 minutes
- Allows comeback opportunity without complete snowball
- One-time activation per match
- Does not prevent bankruptcy if capital reaches $0

## Territory Control & Income Generation

### Capture Zones

The battlefield features multiple contestable zones providing continuous capital generation. Strategic positioning and defensive coordination are essential to maintain income superiority.

**Zone Classification:**

**Minor Control Points** (6-8 per map)
- Description: Supply Depots, Outposts, Forward Positions
- Income Rate: **$50 per second**
- Capture Time: **30 seconds** (uncontested)
- Capture Radius: **15 meters**
- Minimum Capture Force: **1 player**

**Major Control Points** (3-4 per map)
- Description: Communications Towers, Strategic Crossroads, Military Installations
- Income Rate: **$150 per second**
- Capture Time: **60 seconds** (uncontested)
- Capture Radius: **25 meters**
- Minimum Capture Force: **2 players**

**Landmark Objectives** (1-2 per map)
- Description: The Treasury, Power Grid Central, Intelligence Hub
- Initial Capture Bonus: **$5,000**
- Ongoing Income: **$300 per second**
- Capture Time: **90 seconds** (uncontested)
- Capture Radius: **30 meters**
- Minimum Capture Force: **3 players**
- Often centrally located, high-traffic areas

### Capture Mechanics

**Standard Capture Process:**
1. Enter capture radius with minimum required players
2. Capture progress bar begins (only when no enemies present)
3. Contested zones (both teams present) halt all progress and income
4. Zone neutralizes before changing ownership
5. Capturing team must maintain presence until completion

**Income Generation:**
- Begins immediately upon zone capture
- Continues as long as zone remains under team control
- Multiple zones stack income additively
- Contested zones generate no income for either team
- Visual indicators show per-zone income rates

**Tactical Considerations:**
- Spreading across multiple minor points = consistent baseline income
- Concentrating on major points = high-risk, high-reward strategy
- Landmark control = potential game-changing momentum shift

---

## Victory Conditions

### Primary: Bankruptcy

The enemy team's War Chest reaches **$0**. This is the most common and decisive victory condition, occurring when a team's operational costs exceed their income generation capacity.

**Factors Leading to Bankruptcy:**
- Excessive player deaths with escalating respawn costs
- Loss of key income-generating territories
- Overuse of expensive equipment and abilities
- Failed offensive operations with high casualties
- Defensive collapses allowing enemy territory domination

### Secondary: Capital Goal

First team to accumulate **$1,000,000 War Chest** achieves economic victory. This prevents indefinite stalemates when both teams play conservatively.

**Strategic Path:**
- Requires sustained territorial control across multiple zones
- Necessitates defensive excellence to prevent costly deaths
- Typically achieved through landmark objective control
- Forces enemy team to engage or concede

### Tertiary: Time Limit

If the **60-minute match timer** expires without bankruptcy or capital goal:
- Team with highest remaining War Chest wins
- Tie = Draw (both teams retain starting capital or equal amounts)
- Encourages aggressive play to force economic advantage

## Strategic Roles & Tactics

### Player Responsibilities

**Economic Awareness:**
Every player must monitor:
- Team War Chest status (always visible)
- Current income rate from held territories
- Personal death count and next respawn cost
- Enemy War Chest approximate status (delayed 30 seconds)

**Role Specialization:**

**Territorial Aggressors:**
- Primary objective: Capture high-value zones
- Accept higher death costs for strategic gains
- Coordinate multi-point assaults
- Equipped for offensive operations

**Defensive Anchors:**
- Primary objective: Hold captured income zones
- Minimize deaths to preserve capital
- Establish defensive positions on major/landmark points
- Maintain income stream stability

**Economic Support:**
- Focus on efficient equipment usage
- Provide tactical support minimizing team costs
- Resupply teammates (if mechanic implemented)
- Callout economic priorities and threats

**Strike Teams:**
- Focused on disrupting enemy income
- Capture enemy-held zones
- Force enemy respawn cost escalation
- High-skill, high-impact operations

### Team Communication Priorities

Critical callouts:
- "Need backup at Communications Tower - our main income!"
- "Enemy War Chest at $75K - push for bankruptcy!"
- "Hold defensive positions - we're at $180K income lead"
- "Treasury captured - $5K bonus gained, income now $450/sec"
- "Minimize deaths - we're under $60K capital remaining"

### Strategic Decision Making

**Offensive Priorities:**
1. Evaluate current income differential
2. Identify weakly defended enemy zones
3. Calculate acceptable casualty costs vs. potential income gain
4. Execute coordinated multi-squad assaults
5. Establish defensive hold after capture

**Defensive Priorities:**
1. Identify highest-income zones requiring protection
2. Allocate squads proportional to zone value
3. Establish overlapping defensive positions
4. Rotate defenders to maintain fresh forces
5. Call reinforcements before zone loss

**Economic Management:**
- Avoid unnecessary equipment expenditure
- Coordinate offensive pushes to minimize redundant deaths
- Prioritize revives over respawns when safe
- Balance aggressive captures with capital preservation

---

## Balancing Philosophy

### Design Intentions

**Individual Accountability:**
Each player's actions directly impact team success beyond traditional K/D metrics. Reckless play penalizes the entire team through economic drain.

**Strategic Depth:**
Teams must balance offensive territorial expansion, defensive income protection, and capital preservation. Pure combat skill insufficient without economic awareness.

**Comeback Mechanics:**
Mercy system and territorial contestability prevent complete economic snowballing while rewarding superior play.

**Clarity Over Complexity:**
All economic information transparently displayed. No hidden modifiers or unclear cost structures.

### Simplification Choices

**Team-Based Economy:**
- No personal money management
- Shared War Chest eliminates individual hoarding
- Simplified decision-making process

**Fixed Loadouts:**
- No mid-round buy menus
- Equipment selection at spawn only
- Costs tied to team operational capacity

**Clear Objective Value:**
- Income rates permanently displayed on HUD
- Map markers indicate zone classifications
- Real-time income tracking for held territories

## Example Match Scenario

### Opening (0:00-5:00)

**Team Alpha Strategy:**
- Squad 1 rushes Communications Tower (Major Point)
- Squads 2-3 secure nearby Supply Depots (Minor Points)
- Squad 4 defends Alpha's spawn area

**Team Bravo Strategy:**
- All squads concentrate on Treasury (Landmark)
- Ignore minor points for high-risk, high-reward play

**Result:** Alpha secures Comms Tower + 2 Supply Depots ($250/sec). Bravo captures Treasury after costly fight ($300/sec + $5,000 bonus). Alpha initial income advantage, but Bravo has bonus capital.

**Economic Status:**
- Alpha: $248,500 (+$250/sec)
- Bravo: $247,800 (+$300/sec)

### Mid-Game (15:00-30:00)

**Situation:** Bravo's Treasury control providing superior income. Alpha's War Chest slowly declining despite holding more total zones. Multiple Alpha players now at 3-4 deaths each (high respawn costs).

**Alpha Adaptation:**
- Consolidate forces for coordinated Treasury assault
- Accept short-term income loss from abandoned minor points
- High-casualty battle reduces Alpha to $165,000

**Bravo Response:**
- Successfully defends Treasury with organized defense
- Counter-captures Alpha's abandoned Supply Depots
- Now controls Treasury + 3 Minor Points

**Economic Status:**
- Alpha: $165,000 (+$100/sec) - Bleeding capital
- Bravo: $312,000 (+$450/sec) - Dominant position

### Endgame (45:00-Match End)

**Situation:** Alpha's War Chest at $48,000. Mercy system activates (50% respawn reduction). Bravo at $428,000, approaching capital goal.

**Alpha Desperation Play:**
- All-in assault on Treasury to disrupt Bravo income
- Several key players already at 5+ deaths (costly respawns even with Mercy)
- Initial push successful, neutralizes Treasury

**Bravo Final Defense:**
- Immediately redeploys all squads to reclaim Treasury
- Accepts casualties knowing economic cushion remains
- Recaptures Treasury within 90 seconds

**Match Conclusion:**
Alpha's final respawns deplete remaining capital. **Team Bravo wins by bankruptcy** at 48:23 match time.
