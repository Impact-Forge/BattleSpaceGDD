# Evasion & Containment

**Game Mode Type:** Asymmetric Stealth vs. Hunt  
**Player Count:** 1-8 Evaders vs. Variable PMF (2:1 ratio minimum)  
**Match Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Expert - Requires stealth mastery (Evaders) and coordination (PMF)

---

## Overview

Evasion & Containment delivers intensely asymmetric gameplay where a small group of resourceful Evaders must escape a containment zone while hunted by a numerically and technologically superior Professional Military Force (PMF). Evaders rely on stealth, environmental awareness, and non-lethal tactics to survive and extract, while the PMF leverages advanced detection equipment, overwhelming firepower, and rapid reinforcement to eliminate all targets before extraction.

Unlike balanced team vs. team modes, Evasion & Containment creates psychological tension through power imbalance. Evaders experience constant threat awareness, while PMF players must coordinate methodical searches across expansive operational areas. Victory for Evaders means at least one successful extraction; victory for PMF means total containment or neutralization of all Evaders.

## Map Design Requirements

### Spatial Characteristics

**Map Size:**
- **2km x 2km** to **3km x 3km**
- Depends on player counts (larger for more players)
- Must support extended stealth gameplay

**Terrain Variety:**

**High-Cover Areas (40% of map):**
- Dense forests
- Urban ruins
- Industrial complexes
- Purpose: Evader concealment, slow PMF searches

**Mixed-Cover Areas (40% of map):**
- Suburban environments
- Light forests
- Agricultural areas
- Purpose: Balanced risk/reward movement

**Open Areas (20% of map):**
- Fields, clearings, roads
- Rivers, open ground
- Purpose: High-risk crossing zones, PMF advantage

**Vertical Elements:**
- Multi-story buildings
- Elevated positions
- Underground areas
- Purpose: Diverse hiding spots, complex searches

### Exfil Zone Placement

**Two Possible Exfils:**
- Location: **Map edges or corners**
- Distance: **800-1,200 meters** from center
- Opposite Sides: Force strategic choice
- Approach Routes: Multiple paths (minimum 3)

**Exfil Environment:**
- Moderate cover approaching
- Some open ground near extraction zone
- Defensible for PMF if alerted
- Visible from distance (PMF can scout)

### Scavenge Point Distribution

**High-Density Zones:**
- Abandoned structures
- Vehicle graveyards
- Supply depots
- Purpose: Encourage Evader movement, create hotspots

**Low-Density Zones:**
- Open wilderness
- Residential areas
- Purpose: Reward exploration, spread Evaders out

---

## Tactical Considerations

### Evader Strategy

**Stealth Fundamentals:**
- Avoid sprinting (louder footsteps)
- Use Crouch-Walk in proximity to PMF
- Stillness when PMF directly looking
- Stay in cover whenever possible

**Team Coordination:**
- Split or stay together? (Depends on team size)
  - 1-2 Evaders: Stay together
  - 3-5 Evaders: Split into 2 groups
  - 6-8 Evaders: Split into 3 groups
- Communication: Minimal voice (PMF could hear if close)
- Rendezvous points: Pre-planned meeting locations

**Distraction Tactics:**
- Noise Makers: Draw PMF patrols away from team
- Smoke Grenades: Cover group movements
- Sacrifice Play: One Evader distracts while others extract

**Exfil Activation Timing:**
- Early: More time to extract, but longer PMF response time
- Late: Less time to extract, but PMF less prepared
- Optimal: 12-15 minutes into match

### PMF Strategy

**Search Patterns:**
- Grid Search: Systematic area clearance
- Patrol Routes: Cover high-traffic zones
- Overwatch Positions: Monitor open areas
- Avoid: Predictable patterns (Evaders learn routes)

**Communication Protocols:**
- Contact Reports: "Evader spotted, Grid B-4"
- Movement Updates: Coordinate converging forces
- Drone Intel: Share reconnaissance findings
- Discipline: Avoid false contacts, maintain credibility

**Exfil Defense:**
- Pre-Position: Place units near both Exfils early
- Rapid Response: Closest units converge on activated Exfil
- Perimeter Setup: Establish 100-meter cordon
- Overwatch: Elevated positions covering approaches

**Thermal Vision Management:**
- Battery Awareness: Don't deplete during critical moments
- Toggle Discipline: Scan methodically, avoid spam
- Environmental Factors: Smoke reduces effectiveness

## Advanced Tactics

### Evader: The Stillness Ambush

**Setup:**
- Evader activates Stillness in high-traffic area
- PMF patrol walks past undetected
- Evader remains still until PMF fully past
- Escape in opposite direction

**Risk:** If PMF stops to search area thoroughly, may discover
**Reward:** Pass through heavily patrolled areas

### PMF: The Drone Herd

**Tactic:**
- Deploy drone to "push" Evaders toward waiting PMF units
- Drone acts as beater, driving Evaders into ambush
- Requires coordination between Commander and field units

**Execution:**
1. Commander identifies Evader general location
2. PMF units position ahead of Evader retreat path
3. Drone approaches from behind, forces Evader forward
4. Evader runs into ambush

### Evader: The Scavenge Loop

**Strategy:**
- Plan circular route through scavenge points
- Continuously craft items while staying mobile
- Avoid staying in one area too long
- Stockpile Noise Makers for endgame distractions

**Benefit:** Fully equipped for extraction phase
**Risk:** Extended movement increases detection chance

### PMF: The Exfil Bait

**Deception:**
- Leave one Exfil lightly defended (or appear to)
- Evaders activate "easy" Exfil
- Hidden PMF force ambushes extraction attempt

**Execution:**
1. Commander assigns covert units to "weak" Exfil
2. Overt patrols avoid area (make it look neglected)
3. Evaders activate Exfil, believing it's safe
4. Hidden PMF reveal themselves during extraction

## Psychological Dynamics

### Evader Experience

**Constant Tension:**
- Every sound could be PMF
- Paranoia about detection
- High stakes (single death = out of match unless revived)

**Satisfaction Sources:**
- Successful stealth past PMF
- Clever use of distractions
- Coordinated team escape
- Underdog victory against overwhelming odds

### PMF Experience

**Hunter Mentality:**
- Systematic area clearance
- Thrill of detection
- Coordinate team takedowns

**Frustration Points:**
- Evaders slipping away
- False contacts
- Drone destruction
- Time running out

---

## Developer Notes

### Design Pillars

1. **Asymmetric Power:** Evaders weak but mobile, PMF strong but spread thin
2. **Psychological Tension:** Constant threat vs. elusive prey
3. **Stealth Mastery:** Reward patient, disciplined play
4. **Coordinated Hunting:** PMF must work together
5. **Nail-Biting Extractions:** Climactic finales

### Balance Testing Focus

**Metrics:**
- Evader extraction success rate (target: 40-60%)
- Average match duration
- PMF detection efficiency
- Stillness ability usage
- Drone survival time
- Component scarcity vs. crafting frequency

**Adjustment Vectors:**
- Evader stealth effectiveness
- PMF thermal vision battery duration
- Drone capabilities and count
- Scavenge point density
- Exfil activation time
- Map size relative to player counts

- Stun grenades (disorient PMF)
- Taser (close-range disable)

**PMF Tracking Dogs:**
- AI-controlled dogs detect Evader scents
- Follow trail, alert PMF handlers
- Vulnerable to distractions

**Weather Systems:**
- Rain: Reduces thermal effectiveness
- Fog: Limits visibility for both sides
- Wind: Affects audio detection

**Revive Mechanic:**
- Downed Evaders can be revived by teammates
- Risky: Must expose self to revive
- Limited: 1 revive per Evader

---

## Conclusion

Evasion & Containment delivers heart-pounding asymmetric gameplay where resource scarcity, numerical disadvantage, and constant threat create intense psychological pressure. Evaders must master stealth, environmental exploitation, and teamwork to survive against a relentless, technologically superior enemy. PMF players experience the satisfaction of coordinated hunting, methodical searches, and overwhelming firepower.

The mode's scaling ensures Evaders always face overwhelming odds, making every successful extraction a hard-earned victory. The dynamic between invisibility and technology, between evasion and pursuit, creates emergent tactical situations where clever thinking trumps raw power.

**Evasion & Containment is survival warfare:** outnumbered, outgunned, but never outplayed.
