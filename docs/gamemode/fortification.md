# Fortification

**Game Mode Type:** Symmetric Construction & Destruction  
**Player Count:** 32v32 (64 players)  
**Match Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced - Requires planning, construction, and combined arms

---

## Overview

Fortification represents BattleSpace's construction-focused game mode where teams must build, defend, and ultimately destroy enemy fortifications in large-scale engagements. Unlike traditional modes with pre-existing objectives, Fortification requires teams to create their own defensive infrastructure before engaging in offensive operations to eliminate the enemy's constructed base.

The mode emphasizes strategic planning, resource management, and combined arms tactics across expansive maps where base location is not predetermined. Teams must balance construction speed with defensive positioning, then transition from defensive posture to offensive operations once both bases are established. Victory requires destroying the enemy's core structures while preserving your own.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Three-Phase Structure

**Phase 1: Build Phase (15 minutes)**
- Both teams simultaneously construct fortifications
- No combat between teams during this phase
- Limited resources allocated for construction
- Base location chosen by team Commander
- Team votes required for major construction decisions

**Phase 2: Reconnaissance Phase (5-10 minutes)**
- Teams search for enemy base location across large map
- Initial skirmishes begin upon contact
- Intel gathering on enemy fortifications
- Offensive strategy formulation based on enemy defenses

**Phase 3: Assault Phase (40-65 minutes)**
- Full-scale combined arms combat
- Simultaneous attack and defense operations
- Resource depletion through attrition
- Victory achieved through base destruction

## Base Location Selection

### Commander Responsibilities

**Site Selection Criteria:**
- Defensible terrain (elevated positions preferred)
- Flat construction area (minimum **150m x 150m**)
- Multiple approach vectors for offense
- Proximity to map resources (if applicable)
- Distance from enemy spawn: **Minimum 2km**

### Optimal Base Layouts

**Concentric Defense:**
```
Outer Perimeter: Wooden walls + watchtowers
Mid Layer: Reinforced walls + MG emplacements
Inner Core: HQ + critical support structures
Fallback: Concrete barriers around HQ
```

**Segmented Defense:**
```
Multiple fortified sections
Each segment independently defensible
Attackers must clear each zone sequentially
Delays assault, drains attacker resources
```

**Star Fort Design:**
```
Angled walls creating overlapping fields of fire
Corner towers covering all approach vectors
Central HQ with 360° defense capability
Maximum defensive efficiency per resource spent
```

## Tactical Considerations

### Build Phase Strategy

**Resource Priority (Recommended):**
1. HQ Building (2,000) - **Non-negotiable**
2. Power Generator (800) - Powers advanced defenses
3. Perimeter Walls (1,500-2,000) - Basic security
4. Defensive Towers (1,000-1,500) - Elevated fire positions
5. Armory (1,200) - Sustain combat operations
6. Motor Pool (1,500) - Vehicle support (if applicable)
7. Remaining points: Additional walls, towers, automation

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-investing in aesthetics (ornate but weak defenses)
- Ignoring power generator (automated defenses fail)
- Poor wall placement (dead zones in coverage)
- Weak HQ protection (core structure vulnerable)

### Assault Strategy

**Reconnaissance-Based Planning:**
- Identify weakest defensive sector
- Locate power generator (disable automation)
- Spot armory (deplete enemy resupply)
- Avoid heavily fortified kill zones

**Multi-Axis Attack:**
- Primary assault: Main breach effort (60% of force)
- Secondary assault: Diversionary attack (25% of force)
- Reserve: Exploitation/reinforcement (15% of force)

**Systematic Destruction:**
1. Breach outer perimeter
2. Destroy power generator
3. Eliminate defensive towers
4. Neutralize support structures
5. Final assault on HQ

**Sustainability:**
- Establish forward resupply point
- Rotate assault squads (prevent attrition)
- Preserve armor for critical pushes
- Avoid pyrrhic victories (win but depleted)

## Advanced Tactics

### Deception & Feints

**False Base Construction:**
- Small team creates decoy base
- Wastes enemy reconnaissance time
- Main force constructs real base elsewhere
- High-risk, high-reward tactic

**Decoy Structures:**
- Build visible but non-critical structures
- Draw attacker focus away from HQ
- Forces enemy to waste resources on low-value targets

### Special Operations

**Infiltration Teams:**
- Small squad bypasses main defenses
- Target power generator or armory
- Sabotage operations before main assault
- Requires stealth and precise execution

**Artillery/Mortar Harassment:**
- Indirect fire on enemy base during build phase (if allowed)
- Disrupts construction, lowers morale
- Forces defenders to allocate resources to repairs

### Defensive Innovations

**Kill Zones:**
- Intentional gaps in walls
- Channelize attackers into pre-targeted areas
- Overlapping fields of fire from towers
- Mines, traps, automated defenses concentrated

**Elastic Defense:**
- Abandon outer perimeter early
- Conserve forces for mid-layer defense
- Counterattack after attacker overextends
- Retake lost positions opportunistically

## Developer Notes

### Design Pillars

1. **Player-Driven Construction:** No two matches identical
2. **Strategic Depth:** Build and assault phases require different skills
3. **Team Coordination:** Commander direction essential
4. **Combined Arms:** Infantry, vehicles, engineering all critical
5. **Resource Management:** Limited points force prioritization

### Balance Testing Focus

**Metrics:**
- Average base completion rate (target: 90%+ complete builds)
- HQ destruction rate (target: 60% assault success)
- Match duration distribution (target: 60-75 minutes)
- Resource expenditure patterns (identify meta builds)
- Win rate by base layout type

**Adjustment Vectors:**
- Starting construction points
- Structure HP values
- Build times for key structures
- Map size affecting reconnaissance phase
- Time limits per phase

---

## Future Expansion

### Post-Launch Additions

**Advanced Structures:**
- Radar systems (extended minimap range)
- Command bunkers (protected HQ variant)
- Underground tunnels (covert movement)
- Aircraft hangars (if air assets added)

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Weather affecting construction (rain = slower builds)
- Terrain stability (some areas unsuitable)
- Resource scarcity (limited build zones)

**Alternative Win Conditions:**
- Capture the Flag variant (steal enemy supply cache)
- King of the Hill (control central objective zone)
- Time-based resource generation (economy focus)

---

## Conclusion

Fortification transforms BattleSpace into a mode where players shape the battlefield before fighting on it. The construction phase's creative freedom combined with the assault phase's destructive intensity creates a unique gameplay loop emphasizing long-term planning, adaptive strategy, and combined arms coordination.

Teams must excel at both construction and combat. A perfectly built base means nothing if the team cannot defend it. Superior combat skills are insufficient if fortifications are poorly designed. Fortification demands mastery of BattleSpace's full tactical spectrum.

**Fortification is strategic warfare**: build your fortress, find theirs, and tear it down.
