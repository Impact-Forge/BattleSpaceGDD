# Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare)

**Game Mode Type:** Large-Scale Territory Control with Combined Arms  
**Player Count:** 100v100 (200 players) - Future target, MVP: 32v32  
**Match Duration:** 90-180 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Expert - Requires strategic command, logistics, and combined arms mastery

---

## Overview

Multi-Domain Operation (MDO-Warfare) represents BattleSpace's most ambitious and complex game mode, integrating land, air, and maritime warfare into a unified strategic battlefield. Teams compete for territorial control across expansive maps where infrastructure, logistics, and economic management are as critical as combat effectiveness.

Unlike focused objective modes, MDO-Warfare is a persistent battlespace where teams must capture territories, establish supply lines, construct military infrastructure, and coordinate combined arms operations across multiple domains. Victory requires strategic vision from commanders, tactical execution by squad leaders, and disciplined coordination by individual players. This is total warfare where every decision compounds over time.

## Core Systems Integration

### Territory Control

**Grid-Based Map Division:**
- Total Grids: **16-25 territorial zones** per map
- Grid Types: **Towns, Strategic Points, Resource Locations**
- Capture Mechanics: Presence-based with power/comms requirements
- Ownership Benefits: Resource generation, spawn points, strategic positioning

**Grid Classifications:**

**Towns (8-12 per map):**
- Capture Radius: **100 meters** from town center
- Capture Time: **5 minutes** uncontested
- Minimum Capture Force: **3 players**
- Resource Generation: **+100 supplies/minute**
- Special Feature: Constructible infrastructure within town limits

**Strategic Points (4-6 per map):**
- Description: Crossroads, bridges, mountain passes
- Capture Radius: **50 meters**
- Capture Time: **3 minutes** uncontested
- Minimum Capture Force: **2 players**
- Resource Generation: **+50 supplies/minute**
- Special Feature: Elevated positions, choke point control

**Resource Sites (2-4 per map):**
- Description: Fuel depots, ammunition dumps, equipment caches
- Capture Radius: **75 meters**
- Capture Time: **8 minutes** uncontested
- Minimum Capture Force: **4 players**
- Resource Generation: **+200 supplies/minute** + vehicle/equipment bonuses

### Infrastructure System

**Power Grid Network:**

**Power Stations:**
- Function: Enable advanced base functions
- Placement: One per major base location
- Health: **5,000 HP**

## Tactical Considerations

### Strategic Priorities

**Commander Level:**
1. Secure resource-generating territories early
2. Establish power/comms network rapidly
3. Balance infrastructure investment vs. combat assets
4. Coordinate squad objectives to avoid redundancy
5. Preserve supply reserves for critical moments

**Squad Level:**
1. Capture assigned territories efficiently
2. Construct defensive positions in held territories
3. Disrupt enemy supply lines and infrastructure
4. Respond to Commander directives quickly
5. Maintain situational awareness of strategic situation

**Individual Level:**
1. Follow Squad Leader instructions
2. Fulfill role-specific responsibilities
3. Minimize unnecessary deaths (preserve team resources)
4. Report enemy positions and movements
5. Participate in team logistics (resupply, repairs)

### Common Strategic Mistakes

**Over-Expansion:**
- Capturing too many territories without defending them
- Stretches forces thin, enables enemy counter-attacks
- Better: Consolidate fewer territories with strong defenses

**Infrastructure Neglect:**
- Focusing purely on combat while ignoring power/comms
- Leads to non-functional territories, wasted captures
- Better: Assign dedicated engineering squads

**Resource Hoarding:**
- Commander saving supplies for "perfect moment"
- Delays critical infrastructure, vehicle assets
- Better: Invest resources continuously for compounding advantages

**Poor Communication:**
- Squads operating independently without coordination
- Redundant efforts, missed opportunities
- Better: Regular Commander updates, squad leader coordination

## Conclusion

Multi-Domain Operation represents the ultimate expression of BattleSpace's vision: massive-scale combined arms warfare where strategy, logistics, and combat merge into a unified experience. Teams must master not only gunfighting and vehicle operation but also economic management, infrastructure development, and multi-squad coordination.

MDO-Warfare is not a mode for casual play. It demands time investment (90-180 minute matches), team communication, and strategic thinking. But for players seeking depth, complexity, and the satisfaction of contributing to a grander strategic picture, MDO-Warfare delivers an unparalleled tactical experience.

This is warfare beyond the individual soldier. This is command, control, logistics, and combined arms. This is BattleSpace at its fullest.

**Multi-Domain Operation is total warfare**: territory, infrastructure, economy, and combat unified.
