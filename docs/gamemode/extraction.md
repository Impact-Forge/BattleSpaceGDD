**Match Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Moderate - Focus on CQC tactics and coordination

---

## Overview

Extraction represents BattleSpace's high-intensity, objective-focused game mode emphasizing close quarters combat, rapid decision-making, and tactical coordination. Teams compete in asymmetric scenarios where attackers must secure and extract high-value targets or intelligence while defenders prevent mission success through area denial and tactical positioning.

The mode's compact map design and focused objectives create intense firefights in urban environments, building interiors, and confined operational zones. Success requires precise communication, role specialization, and adaptability as mission parameters evolve throughout the match.

- Primary Objective: Prevent successful extraction
- Secondary Objective: Eliminate attackers or run out the clock
- Respawn Limit: **8 respawns per player** (20-second delay)
- Defensive Advantage: Knowledge of map and objective locations

### Objective Types

## Match Flow

### Phase Breakdown

**Preparation Phase (60 seconds):**

**Attackers:**
- Review objective location (revealed at phase start)
- Plan breach vectors and team assignments
- Distribute specialized equipment
- Position at designated spawn point **300-500m** from objective

**Defenders:**
- Fortify objective building and surrounding area
- Deploy razor wire, barricades, traps
- Establish defensive positions and killzones
- Assign roving patrols vs. static defenders

**Assault Phase (15-20 minutes):**

**Initial Contact (0-5 minutes):**
- Attackers approach objective compound
- Reconnaissance and breach point identification
- Initial defender contact and probe engagements
- Attacker adapts to defender positioning

**Breach & Clear (5-12 minutes):**
- Coordinated multi-point breach execution
- Intense CQC firefights within structures
- Objective location secured by attackers
- Defenders execute counterattacks or tactical retreats

**Extraction Phase (Final 3-8 minutes):**
- Attackers escort objective to extraction zone
- Defenders establish ambush positions along egress routes
- High-casualty engagements during vulnerable escort
- Time pressure intensifies as match timer depletes

**Resolution:**
- **Attacker Victory:** Objective reaches extraction zone within time limit
- **Defender Victory:** Time expires or all attackers eliminated
- **Draw:** Objective secured but extraction incomplete (rare)

## Tactical Considerations

### Attacker Strategy

**Reconnaissance:**
- Deploy forward scouts to identify defender positions
- Use drones/cameras if available to map interior
- Identify primary and alternate breach points
- Assess defender fortification strength

**Breach Execution:**
- Simultaneous multi-point entry to divide defender attention
- Flashbangs and smoke preceding entry teams
- Rapid room clearing with lethal efficiency
- Immediate establishment of secure perimeter

**Extraction Coordination:**
- Designate security team vs. escort team
- Clear egress routes before moving objective
- Use suppression to protect vulnerable asset
- Maintain communication throughout extraction

**Common Mistakes:**
- Single breach point (easily defended killzone)
- Slow methodical clearing (time runs out)
- Abandoning wounded (depletes respawn pool)
- Poor objective protection during extraction

### Defender Strategy

**Fortification Priorities:**
- Reinforce breach points near objective
- Create interlocking fields of fire
- Establish fallback positions for layered defense
- Deploy traps at likely attack vectors

**Defensive Posture:**
- Maintain 60% static defenders on objective
- Deploy 40% roving rapid-response force
- Avoid full commitment to initial breach points
- Preserve respawns for critical late-game defense

**Extraction Denial:**
- Pre-position ambush sites along extraction routes
- Focus fire on objective carrier (VIP/intel/asset)
- Force attackers to choose between speed and security
- Exploit attacker vulnerability during escort

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-fortifying one breach point (attackers go elsewhere)
- Aggressive counterattacks (waste respawns early)
- Ignoring extraction routes (late-game surprise)
- Poor communication leading to undefended areas

## Advanced Tactics

### Breaching Techniques

**Dynamic Entry:**
1. Flashbang through window/door
2. Immediate breach 1-2 seconds after detonation
3. First man clears immediate threat sector
4. Subsequent entries clear remaining sectors
5. Establish 360° security before advancing

**Slow Methodical Clear:**
1. Pre-breach reconnaissance (cameras/drones)
2. Identify defender positions before entry
3. Suppression fire to fix defenders
4. Alternate entry point breach during suppression
5. Room-by-room clearance with security halts

**Explosive Breach:**
1. Place breaching charge on door/wall
2. Stack team on hinges side (away from breach)
3. Detonate charge
4. Wait 1-2 seconds for debris/smoke
5. Simultaneous entry from multiple teams

### Defender Counter-Tactics

**Ambush Positioning:**
- Avoid standing directly behind breach points (explosive danger)
- Position at angles to breach (crossfire killzone)
- Maintain communication with adjacent defenders
- Fallback trigger: 50% defender casualties in area

**Delaying Actions:**
- Use grenades to deny entry temporarily
- Reposition during enemy suppression/smoke
- Force attackers to clear same room twice
- Waste attacker time without wasting defender lives

**Extraction Ambush:**
- Identify likely extraction routes early
- Pre-place defenders in concealed positions
- Allow objective to pass initial checkpoints
- Ambush during vulnerable escort phase

## Developer Notes

### Design Pillars

1. **Fast-Paced CQC:** Engagements conclude in seconds, reward quick reflexes
2. **Asymmetric Balance:** Different advantages create varied tactical approaches
3. **Objective Focus:** Combat serves mission goals, not pure elimination
4. **Team Dependency:** Solo play ineffective, coordination essential
5. **High Replayability:** Randomized elements and multiple tactics

### Balance Testing Focus

**Metrics to Monitor:**
- Win rate balance (target: 50-55% attacker advantage)
- Average match duration (target: 20-25 minutes)
- Extraction phase engagement rate (should be high-intensity)
- Role utilization (ensure all roles relevant)
- Spawn point exploitation (prevent camping)

**Adjustment Vectors:**
- Objective location randomization
- Respawn count per team
- Extraction zone hold times
- Defender fortification strength
- Map approach vectors

---

## Conclusion

Extraction delivers focused, high-stakes combat where every decision impacts mission outcome. The mode's emphasis on objective-based gameplay, tactical coordination, and close quarters engagement creates intense matches where attackers must balance speed with caution, and defenders must balance aggression with preservation.

Unlike large-scale territorial modes, Extraction condenses BattleSpace's tactical depth into compact 20-30 minute engagements. Every player matters, every breach point counts, and every second on the clock creates pressure. This is BattleSpace at its most focused: small teams, tight spaces, critical objectives.

**Extraction is precision tactical combat**: fast, lethal, unforgiving.
