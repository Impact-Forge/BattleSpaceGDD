The Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air-superiority aircraft. Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an improved all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations.![1200px-F-15C.jpg](files/3d88ba02-a656-4ed6-8fe5-bc3b59ba6394/1200px-F-15C.jpg)<br># Cockpit There are several F-15 variants have been produced and their cockpits will vary form variants!  ![F-15cocpit.PNG](files/d5cca002-40b6-4571-b82d-7b700b596f1e/F-15cocpit.PNG)

It was intended as a direct competitor for the large US fourth-generation jet fighters such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, with 3,530-kilometre (1,910 nmi) range, heavy aircraft ordnance, sophisticated avionics and high maneuverability. The Su-27 was designed for air superiority missions, and subsequent variants are able to perform almost all aerial warfare operations.![Sukhoi\_Su-27SKM\_at\_MAKS-2005\_airshow.jpg](files/f292e14e-6888-4b52-af22-36ea66f1770b/Sukhoi_Su-27SKM_at_MAKS-2005_airshow.jpg)<br># Cockpit![30328950\_d269f13ca52a7424ef8698dd7f9db0d5\_800.jpg](files/7dfa816c-ad40-438d-9fc0-f33e3b9d260f/30328950_d269f13ca52a7424ef8698dd7f9db0d5_800.jpg)* SU-27 Flanker| **First flight**  | December 1984                                                                                                                                           |

It was designed to replace the ageing A-5C, F-7P/PG, Mirage III, and Mirage V combat aircraft in the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).The JF-17 can be used for multiple roles, including interception, ground attack, anti-ship, and aerial reconnaissance. The Pakistani designation "JF-17" stands for "Joint Fighter-17", with the "-17" denoting that, in the PAF's vision, it is the successor to the F-16. The Chinese designation "FC-1" stands for "Fighter China-1".# Cockpit![J17.jpg](files/8e887083-e329-4ff4-94cf-7d3affb8a160/J17.jpg)- CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In service since 1976, it is named for the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, a World War II-era fighter-bomber effective at attacking ground targets, but commonly referred to as the "Warthog" or simply "Hog". The A-10 was designed to provide close air support (CAS) to friendly ground troops by attacking armored vehicles, tanks, and other enemy ground forces; it is the only production-built aircraft designed solely for CAS to have served with the U.S. Air Force. Its secondary mission is to direct other aircraft in attacks on ground targets, a role called forward air controller-airborne; aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10.![acc6eb203cb9cb0108254444c48f8e6a.jpg](files/f4f6f8cb-ddb5-468c-9a7f-ea7685233558/acc6eb203cb9cb0108254444c48f8e6a.jpg)# Cockpit![A-10-cockpit.jpg](files/b7b123eb-87d4-4dfe-9df9-7c05231acfd8/A-10-cockpit.jpg)* A-10 Thunderbolt| **First flight**  | 1972                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
